Model: Whole organism recorded (any combination of sound, image, video, field notes) in the wild and entered in a collection database. 

Model: Whole organism captured, recorded (sound, image, video) along with measurements, released in the wild and entered in a collection database.

Model: Whole organism collected from captivity and put into a collection.

Model: Whole organism collected from the wild, but escaped from captivity, and put into a collection.

Model: Parasite of organism, parasite cataloged with specimen of organism.

Model: Parasite of organism, parasite cataloged separate from specimen (in the same or in a different collection).

Model: Record of organism, where specimen is now in another collection.

Model: Repeated instances of material sample for the same organism over time, then organism put into a collection.

Model: Repeated instances of material sample for the same captive organism over time, then organism put into a collection.

Model: Repeated instances of the same organism (with media, literature) captured over time.

Model: Multiple organisms collected in the wild together, put into a collection and cataloged as a lot.

##### Fossil specimen

##### Living specimen
